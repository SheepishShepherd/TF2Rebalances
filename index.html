						Using this gun as a finisher is not utilized as much as the utility of the jump height.
						The 2-4 bonus damage isn’t enough to compensate for nearly half the clip.<br />

						Adding a firing rate bonus could pair well with the damage bonus, potentially finishing off the target quicker if you land your shots.

						<span class="item-name">Problem</span><br />
						Enemies typically do not shoot players under the Bonk! effect.
						The slowdown is not impactful enough if the item is used to escape, making it feel imilar to the Dead Ringer.
						Because of this, this item has been used almost exclusively for Sentry tanking.<br />
					</p>
					<p class="stat neutral" style="margin-top: 15px;">
						<span class="item-name" style="">Solution</span><br />
						Making the effect expire prematurely from damage allows the enemy to at least attempt to catch the Scout before he manages to escape.
						To balance this out, the consumption has been made less restricting.
